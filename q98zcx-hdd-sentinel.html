I have an SSD(128gb) just for windows 10 and other apps that i use a lot(Opera, Skype) and a 2TB HDD for games, movies etc. The prblem is, windows randomly stops working. First time i cleaned the dust in my pc and when i turned it on, it made me choose my keyboard layout and then none of the "troubleshoot" options worked. Automatic repair, restore to a certain point, downngrade to an older version, none of them worked. So i just assumed i forgot Hey guys, I am having an issue with my laptop- I think its an L550 or something along those lines- it was a ,000 laptop I bought back in 2014 with a 1TB Toshiba HDD, 740m GTX Nvidia Graphics w/ 4gb of dedicated RAM, 8 gb of DDR3 RAM and possibly some other specs, I am not by my computer atm, but when I get home I will edit this post for accuracy. Roughly a year ago, I updated my computer to Windows 10 ultimate through school- ever since then, I cannot close my lid to put the laptop in sleep. Okay,just the other day i stumbled by a garage sale where dude was selling Seagate 500Gb drives for 5 dollars a piece and he had about 30 pieces in there. Now i thought about picking up a few drives just for testing stuff,RAID configs and maybe backups however i was heading to work and didn't have where to store them so i decided not to buy them. However,i was thinking about testing those drives there on the spot since used drives can sometimes be faulty. My idea was carrying Video with sound (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb19JKKuYMampfeature=youtu.be) Picture 1 (https://i.imgur.com/4ArSiS3.png) Picture 2 (https://i.imgur.com/xIjIHe0.png) I remember doing a read test with hdd sentinel last week, all squares/sectors were light green(good) with a couple of darker green but it said nothing about them. I've had this drive for ~15 months and I think its been making this sound since I bought it? But today I turned off my case fan which so for quite some time now i ran into a issue where drivepool will say a given hdd is missing and i have fixed in the pass by repairing/ reinstalling drivepool, changing hdd port, cable but in this occasion i ran out of patient after rebooting computer like 10 times and disk was still missing, the strange thing is that even though hdd showed missing in drivepool, i was able to see it under disk management, hdd sentinel, minitool partition wizard, etc. so i went ahead with minitool partition. The issue is as the title says,this happened to me before,but rarely,now it got more common. One thing I noticed is that my AMD Display Driver crashes sometimes out of the blue,even when I'm not playing anything. The freeze happens only when I'm gaming,what I suspect is that the problem is of driver nature,because the sound during the freeze is caused by the PC rather than it's component. During the crash/freeze nothing seems to work and I'm forced to plug the computer out of the wall. 
So recently I've been getting some momentary framerate/display type lag. It happens when I'm gaming, using Firefox, basically doing anything no matter the load. It's that kind of lag that freezes the screen for just a moment or two, then everything seems to suddenly appear like it should. This happens in everything from League of Legends to Battlefield 1 to just normal browsing. My build is: GTX 1080ti, not overclocked 7700k, also not overclocked 2x 8GB 3000MHz Corsair RAM 2x 2TB Seagate. Wondering if anyone else here runs a write + read surface scan on new HDD's before transferring data. I use HDD sentinel, and I do it to verify the disk is good, in addition to check smart values before and after. Does anyone else do this? Any other tips and tricks to share for testing out new drives. All item prices are shipped except when noted. Just cleaning out some excess gear I don’t have a use for currently.

Edit: Local is 95124, San Jose, can drive a bit around the Bay Area if need be.

Hello, one day while updating a game it froze, bsod happened, and when the pc restarted it didnt detect my pc anymore(reboot and select proper boot device message or something)  I forcefully shut down the pc by button and when I piwered it on next time it booted normally. Day after I ran HDD Sentinel and it said health is 4%. Few days later I tried to copy a folder to my usb but on 13% pc bsoded and same thing happened. Now my question is, is it safe for me to try to save folders like this?. so i started into datahoarder/jbod/ hdd pooling not to long ago, im planning on filling up my 4x8tb hdd with movies/ tv show, etc, my current set is: hdd sentinel: for real time monitoring. (how real time are we talking about here) StableBit software: for pooling and some kind of protection snapraid: not using right now because i cant afford to dedicated 1x8tb for parity my question is since im new to this how does hdd failure work, for my understanding hdd sentinel will start picking. I recently got a new system case, and after transferring all of my hardware over, it seems like there's a gurgling/boiling type sound coming from my computer. I tried it with my hard drives unplugged and only my SSD installed, and the sounds disappeared so I assume it's coming from my hard drives. Running a check with HDD Sentinel and SeaTools gives me green lights across the board though, so is it something I can fix/should worry about. Tell me please, is there any way of knowing if hdd is in sleep mode? This is when we set the power scheme for example, put the power off for 5 minutes, and after 5 minutes our hard drive falls asleep until we again turn to it. I watched programs like hdd sentinel, crystaldiskinfo, etc., but did not find anything like that. It is necessary to learn specifically in a sleep mode now Hdd or not. Option - go to the folder and if there is a slight delay - it's a sleep mode, do not offer). 
It contained non-essential, backed up files, was previously used as a backup drive until it started showing SMART errors. Interestingly I had spoken with a Seagate Tech support only 2 weeks ago after I noticed a huge spike in SMART errors and HDD Sentinel reported 10% Health. They got me to run Seagate Tools which showed no issues and the drive passed all tests but it died, as expected, anyway. Time to give it a proper burial.and keep a close eye on it's brother (my second ST3000DM001 which. Hello, and sorry if this is not the right place for my question. i have an OCZ SSD 460A 120GB, i have it fore about 3-4 years, and it has about 86% Of life according to HDD Sentinel, Also i get the same value from OCZ's Software, altough it says "Excellent" when i should start changing the drive. I'm just wondering if anyone of you regularly do surface scans of your discs and whether or not this wears out the drive faster than not doing scans. I use HDD Sentinel or HDTune and scan my disks semi-annually, to try and anticipate any failures. I only do the read scan, not the read/write. I wonder if a read/write scan would be appropriate for new drives. Any other thoughts are welcome. Thanks. </p>
