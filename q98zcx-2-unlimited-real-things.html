                            <p> I've rewatched this episode about 4 times now and just as I was on the first watch, on the second watch, third watch, fourth watch ,I'm certain. I've come to a conclusion. Only a character that was not on The Night King's Radar at all could've possibly killed him. Here is why: Throughout the Episode The Long Night  The Night King keeps away from the battle until victory is all but assured. The people complaining about Arya killing him have completely ignored the context of the episode. I read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and OP from that post recommended that I make my comment a post of its own. After all the times I've been helped by this community, this finally feels like my opportunity to give back. Here goes! \ cracks knuckles\ amp#x200B; So I've been struggling with this lately myself. I've been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one. Now that I have the money to do it I keep getting cold feet and thinkin. Hey all, J_Alexander_HS (https://www.twitch.tv/j_alexander_hs) back again today to look at the topic of nerfs. With the new Standard rotation, the meta has, without question, dramatically improved in terms of player experience. Nevertheless, people are talking about nerfs (because when aren't we?), specifically to the two top classes in the meta right now: Warrior and Rogue. Warrior is pretty straight-forward case in terms of the ire directed at it, and with good reason: Edit:will update post once I’m moved in, still going to be interesting how my mom will punish me but we shall see. So far I’m just getting stonewalled which is A’okay with me🤣 Update #1: everything sectioned together and ready to move tomorrow!! https://ibb.co/M16b2XL https://ibb.co/7z6mBsZ Moving day Update#2:Thank you all for the support, I’m reading every reply. Lots of great advice here, kind of worried about making it on my own. but I’m the type of person that’ll Hi all, I wanted to take a bit of time to write-up my experience with step 1, as well as extend a huge thank you to u/zankistep1, u/bluegalaxies, and many others in this community for these incredible resources. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. As for a write-up of my step 1 experience, I want to give a summary of how I studied, which decks I used, deck settings, what I changed leading up to and in dedicated, the test itself, and regrets as well as things I’m glad I did. This journey. TL;DR my husband's income just jumped from K to 8K, all our dreams are about to come true amp#x200B; EDIT 1: YES I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALARY AND TOTAL COMPENSATION AND HOW BONUSES WORK THERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF HIS PAY AT THE BOTTOM WE DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE ACCEPTING THE OFFER THANKS EDIT 2: Thank you for all of your amazing, kind, supportive comments EDIT 3: My husband's resources include freecodecamp.com (https://freecodecamp.com), udemy, youtube, podcasts 
Previous: Inside Underground NY Poker #4 (https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/befccs/inside_underground_ny_poker_4/) amp#x200B; Spades — 1.4 One of the many things that fascinates me about poker is the clear distinction between tournament players and cash players. Anyone who’s played enough live poker, both cash and tournaments, knows how different the experiences can be. In general, tournament players are more social and laid back. They’ll usually talk strategy at the table #HAPPY SATURDAY DEPLORABLES! This is u/ivaginaryfriend here to deliver you all things dank and spicy from the past week! If you happened to miss any past recaps you can catch those here! (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7rrudy/rthe_donalds_first_year_of_winning_anniversary/) I ALSO want to remind everyone about the TRUMP RALLY TONIGHT AT 8 PM ET!!!!! (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/bhxmkx/when_you_wake_up_and_remember_theres_a_rally/) We will of course Since the new the update I've been looking into all the new things. I haven't been able to play enough multiplayer yet to form a solid opinion on anything so this is mostly about the campaign, though I will include some thoughts on multiplayer. Also since this is mostly about the campaign, I'm not really going to bother deciding whether something is OP or not, because that's subjective. Instead I'll just weigh things based on how they fit into their faction and the Lore, and how they effect. A new study found that sexlessness is at an all time high  Here are what I believe to be some of the main reasons for it: 1.) Online Dating : Private studies (https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) and data released by OLD apps such as Tinder (https://zirby.co/blog/tinder-guide-for-men#whats-the-average-response-rate-on-tinder) and OKCupid (https://theblog.okcupid. My very first instance of gambling came from the MMO called AION. It was a PC game, revolving around PvE / PvP content, from raids, to 1v1 arenas, to story quests, and so on. I never got into WoW, but if have ever played WoW, it's very similar. The reason I got hooked to AION, was because of the amazing art style. It felt as if you were a part of the game itself, with colorful, animated characters, great classes to choose from (Assassin, Gladiator, Cleric, etc.) I think they had about. I don't know about you guys, but personally these all these build guides are just so complicated and mind boggling. Survivalist Berserk SMG build? I ain't no masochist, and I ain't gonna live on the edge like some drunk tightrope walker. Demolitionist Mad bomber build? I ain't got the time to be counting how many grenades I still have and making sure every of them lands just right. Sharpshooter Unstoppable build? I want to play the damn game! Not worry about how many imaginary reds or blues. TL;DL: Both Garfield and Skaff think the core game mechanics and game design are solid. They explain it's more like a Real Time Strategy game then a trading card game because the quantity of decisions made in such a short time. People who play Artifact a lot will feel the oomph that it provides, as opposed to a lot of games that are focused on fitting everything on a small screen. Artifact is difficult to spectate if you haven't played it before, but like basketball or cricket Gear album: https://imgur.com/a/2fTeZgo I've been meaning to put one of these together forever, so here goes! I'll just start by saying up front that this is not a minimalist pack. I'd call myself a pretty seasoned ultralight backpacker, but currently my priorities are a little different. I've been on the road since September with my girlfriend, working remotely for a software agency back in the US. I spent a lot of time on this sub agonizing about bags and gear before leaving Cal Dining has done it again. First, we lose dining dollars. Now, the plans get even worse. Not even getting into the off-campus meal plans (don't pay to eat at a dining hall when you don't have to), the on-campus plans for next semester are hot garbage. Here, I'm going to highlight one particular way which Cal Dining is not-so-subtly trying to shaft the incoming class of 2023 and all future Berkeley students. Witness: 2019-2020 Cal Dining on-campus meal plans. 
Seeing as the NY underground poker posts have been so popular, I figure I can give a bit of a different perspective on the underground scene of the mid 2000s. The Boston scene wasn't nearly as big as the NY scene, but there were still some big games and wild characters involved. I started off in small college games, so if you're only interested in the big mob associated games and stuff like that, this first part will probably bore you. I'm not going to bother changing names in the story. Hello all, I'm (among other things) a graduate student getting a master's degree in cybersecurity. This last quarter for one of my classes, I was tasked to examine and recreate an exploit. For the actual exploit I was examining the "anyone can spend" segwit addresses on the BCH chain, and in my research I found a 0k theft that seems to have gone completely unnoticed. You all might recall this (/r/Bitcoin/comments/7eixcu/recovering_bch_sent_to_segwit_addresses/) 0k theft of segwit address. Hello! amp#x200B; I am in the process of world building for my upcoming high-fantasy campaign. Im my campaign, there is no real states - world is divided by dozen or so city-states that loosely control territories around them. I want each city-state to have its own identity and idiosyncrasies. amp#x200B; However, I also want to stress that these city-states are functioning around few notions: populations of city-states are not racially homogeneous, but very diverse and each race feels. Mother Theresa is for some reason considered a synonym for a real saint and a great person, but she was actually a sadistic deviant who founded lots of insanitary clinics, where patients where deliberately kept in bad condition, because Theresa considered all suffering people to be sinners and thought they should suffer like Jesus Christ did. She recieved donations from most cruel dictators of her time, and never actually used her almost unlimited wealth to actually help people in need.
