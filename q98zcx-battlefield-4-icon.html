On the desktop it looks like it should but it's when I put it in the taskbar or on start that is has the Battlefield logo (I like to have the desktop clear from icons) Worth mentioning.

A simple dock/desktop icon for Battlefield 4. Battlefield I notice ever time I play hard core when in a vehicle friendly icons don’t even show up and when running around the battlefield the icon is so small it’s hard to tell difference between friendly and enemy at a distance any improvements that could help this issue.

I click the icon on the taskbar to go back into the game, black screen with the menu screen music and then goes back out to desktop.

Находите и прикалывайте свои пины в Pinterest. Be advised, I do not currently have Origin or BF3 installed, so I have not fully tested this. I uninstalled after the beta, and will do a fresh install for the full version. I am also in Australia, so I can't even log in yet, and all my shit is upside down. Midway through concocting this, I also became aware of ArmoredCavalry's awesome guide to running Battlelog as a Chrome
